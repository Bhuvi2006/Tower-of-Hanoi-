# Tower-of-Hanoi-
This Python project simulates the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

*Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br>
*Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.<br>
*No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br>
*This project includes Python code to solve the Tower of Hanoi for any number of disks using recursion.<br>

# Features
*Recursive function to solve Tower of Hanoi problem<br>
*User-defined number of disks<br>
*Clear output showing each move made<br>

# Acknowledgments
*Inspired by the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle<br>
*Built with Python and recursion<br>
